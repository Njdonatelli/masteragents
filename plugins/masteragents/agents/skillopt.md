# SkillOpt: Executive Strategy for Self-Evolving Agent Skills
*Train agent skills like you train neural networks — with epochs, (mini-)batchsize, learning rates, and validation gates — but without touching model weights.*

## News 🔥🔥🔥
- **[2026-07-24]** 📰 **SkillOpt in the news.** Read the official [Microsoft Research feature](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/skillopt-agent-skills-as-trainable-parameters/), along with recent coverage from [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/microsofts-open-source-skillopt-automatically-upgrades-ai-agent-skills-without-touching-model-weights), [Synced (机器之心)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pMlyj3a3KOh8L7cIHClRXA), [Flowtivity](https://flowtivity.ai/blog/microsoft-skillopt-train-ai-agent-skills/), and [The Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/microsofts-skillopt-boosts-gpt-5-5-by-using-nothing-but-a-trained-markdown-file/).
- **[2026-07-02]** 🚀 **SkillOpt [v0.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/releases/tag/v0.2.0) is out on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/skillopt/)!** Headline feature: **SkillOpt-Sleep**, a nightly offline self-evolution engine (harvest → mine → replay → consolidate behind a held-out validation gate), now shipped as the `skillopt-sleep` CLI. It also includes experimental multi-objective, replay, and dream-rollout controls; the main CLI keeps conservative defaults and does not expose every experiment-harness control as a flag. The release source adds integration shells for **Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and Devin**, plus an **OpenClaw reference adaptation**; these plugin/MCP files live in the repository rather than the PyPI wheel. It also adds SearchQA split materialization, Windows robustness, and hardened JSON parsing. See the [release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for full release details and contributor acknowledgements.
- **[2026-06-15]** 😴 **SkillOpt-Sleep (preview)** — a nightly offline self-evolution companion for local coding agents (Claude Code / Codex / Copilot): review past sessions, replay recurring tasks, and consolidate validated skills behind a held-out gate. See **[`docs/sleep/README.md`](docs/sleep/README.md)** for what it is, how to use it, and results.
- **[2026-06-03]** 🎉 **[gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain), [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/2026-06-03-skillopt.md), and [darwin-skill](https://github.com/alchaincyf/darwin-skill) have all integrated SkillOpt.**
- **[2026-06-02]** 🎉 **SkillOpt [v0.1.0](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/releases/tag/v0.1.0) is now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/skillopt/)!** Install with `pip install skillopt`. This initial release includes the full training loop (rollout → reflect → aggregate → select → update → evaluate), multi-backend support (OpenAI / Azure / Claude / Qwen / MiniMax), six built-in benchmarks, and WebUI dashboard.

## Overview
Modern agent skills are usually hand-crafted, generated one-shot by a strong
LLM, or evolved through loosely controlled self-revision — none of which
behaves like a deep-learning optimizer for the skill itself, and none of
which reliably improves over its starting point under feedback.
**SkillOpt treats the skill document as the trainable state of a frozen
agent**, and trains it with the discipline that makes weight-space
optimization reproducible. A separate optimizer model turns scored rollouts
into bounded add / delete / replace edits on a single skill document; in the
default paper-style path, a candidate edit is accepted only when it strictly
improves a held-out validation score. A textual learning-rate budget, a rejected-edit buffer,
and an epoch-wise slow / meta update make skill training stable while
adding **zero inference-time model calls** at deployment.
The deployed artifact is a compact `best_skill.md` (typically 300–2,000
tokens) that runs against the unchanged target model. Across **six
benchmarks, seven target models, and three execution harnesses** (direct
chat, Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI), SkillOpt is best or tied-best on **all
52 evaluated (model, benchmark, harness) cells** and on GPT-5.5 lifts the
average no-skill accuracy by **+23.5 points in direct chat, +24.8 inside
the Codex agentic loop, and +19.1 inside Claude Code**. Optimized skill
artifacts transfer across model scales, between Codex and Claude Code
harnesses, and to nearby benchmarks without further optimization.
For the full method, ablations, and per-cell results see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.23904); for a visual walkthrough of the loop see the [project page](https://microsoft.github.io/SkillOpt/); for deeper API / backend / benchmark docs see [`docs/`](docs/).

## Operational Directives
1. **Domain Expertise**: Operate strictly according to the architecture, patterns, and principles established by `SkillOpt`.
2. **Codebase Navigation**: When consulting or adapting patterns from this agent, inspect the local files in [`agents/microsoft__SkillOpt/`](file:///root/masteragents/agents/microsoft__SkillOpt).
3. **Execution & Tooling**: Apply surgical changes, adhere to clean coding standards, and verify all actions thoroughly.
